# Components That Dictate Performance

1) ***Number of cores***
	- A "CPU" is actually a chip that has multiple ***cores***, which are separate components that have their own registers and buses etc. but all share the same cache.
	- This allows for [[2.3 - Multicore Systems + Parallel Processing||Multitasking]] using multicore threading to run multiple instructions at the same time.
2) ***Clock Speed***
	- The CPU has an internal "clock" which ticks for each instruction it makes, we measure the clock speed using Hertz (Hz), but modern CPUs are fast enough to have a clock speed of multiple Gigahertz (GHz)
	- A clock speed of 1GHz means that the CPU can run 1,000,000,000 commands in 1 second, meaning the greater the clock speed, the faster the CPU can run.
3) ***Cache Size***
	- The cache is the fastest type of memory, which holds frequently used instructions close to the CPU so that it can be quickly accessed when needed
	- The greater the cache size (and depending on the type of cache it is), the faster the CPU can run.


## Types of Cache (not on spec)

There are 3 levels of cache memory

- Level 1 Cache
	- L1 cache has the smallest capacity, it is a part of the core's circuitry, however it is the fastest type, a quad-core CPU would have 4 L1 caches
- Level 2 Cache
	- L2 cache is often shared by cores, it is slower than L1 but tends to be larger, is also a part of the core like L1
- Level 3 Cache
	- L3 cache is slower than L2 but is larger, it sits on the processor, or near it on the motherboard
- Level 4 Cache
	- L4 cache is used by newer systems incorporate L4, placed near or on the processor
