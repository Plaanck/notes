# The Fetch Stage

- The fetch stage is the most complex stage of the FDE cycle, it is the part of the cycle where the CPU is trying to find what the next instruction is, and get it ready to be decoded

- It starts by checking the program counter, as it holds the address of the next instruction to be executed
- The address is then copied into the memory address register
- The address is then sent along the address bus to main memory where it waits to get a signal from the control bus
- From the main memory, the control unit sends signal along control bus to the main memory
- The contents stored in memory at the address can be sent along the data bus to the MDR
- The data received by the MDR from memory gets copied to the CIR
- The instruction is fetched, and the program counter increments before decoding starts.


# The Decode Stage

- Now that the current instruction is being held in the CIR, it is ready to be decoded.
- The instruction is made up of 2 parts, the Opcode, and the Operand (see [[4 - Types Of Programming Language#Addressing Memory|Addressing Memory]])
- The opcode is the actual instruction, whereas the operand is the memory location that will be effected by the process
- For example, you could get the instruction 101010011 in the CIR.
	- The first 4 bits would represent the opcode, let's say that it means load
	- This would then load the contents of the value stored in memory location 0011.
	- In this representation there would only be 16 actual instructions that can be processed, but in real life the instruction would be much larger


# The Execute Stage

- We then send the address stored in the operand to the Memory Address Register, which then gets sent down the memory bus into main memory
- Seeing that we want to read the data that is stored in that memory address, the control unit sends a read signal down the control bus to main memory.
- This data can now be sent to the MDR through the Data bus from main memory
- The contents of the MDR are then sent to the accumulator (general purpose register), therefore completing the execute stage.
