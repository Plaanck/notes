# The Fetch Stage

- The fetch stage is the most complex stage of the FDE cycle, it is the part of the cycle where the CPU is trying to find what the next instruction is, and get it ready to be decoded

- It starts by checking the program counter, as it holds the address of the next instruction to be executed
- The address is then copied into the memory address register
- The address is then sent along the address bus to main memory where it waits to get a signal from the control bus
- From the main memory, the control unit sends signal along control bus to the main memory
- The contents stored in memory at the address can be sent along the data bus to the MDR
- The data received by the MDR from memory gets copied to the CIR
- The instruction is fetched, and the program counter increments before decoding starts.
