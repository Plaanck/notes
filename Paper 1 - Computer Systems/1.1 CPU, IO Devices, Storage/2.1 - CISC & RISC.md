## Instruction Set

- The core of all computers is the instruction set
	-  The instruction set is the set of all instructions in machine code that can be recognized and executed by a given CPU / processor
- There are 2 types of processors that deal with the instruction set
	- CISC: Complex Instruction Set Computer
	- RISC: Reduced Instruction Set Computer


## CISC

- CISC aims to complete instructions in as few lines of assembly as possible,
- This means that the circuitry and hardware needs to be more complex to be able to handle more complex instructions.
- For example, in base assembly, multiplying two numbers together would require loading both numbers, finding the product, and storing the result.
- However, CISC would use a single line to do all of that in one line of code, meaning it uses a higher level language which is still essentially assembly

## RISC

- RISC aims to use simple instructions in base assembly, but execute each one within a single [[1.3 - CPU Performance#Components That Dictate Performance||Clock Speed]]
- Higher level assembly commands will not exist in these processors, and we would need to separate it into its smaller commands.
- More RAM is needed to store each assembly instruction, as there are more lines, making it seem less efficient at first
- However each instruction can be completed in one clock cycle, meaning we can use [[1.4 - Pipelining||pipelining]] to increase the efficiency, CISC cannot do this.
