## What Is Pipelining

- Pipelining is a technique used by processors to improve performance and efficiency
- It makes use of the [[1.2 - Fetch Decode Execute Cycle||Fetch Decode Execute Cycle]], without pipelining the steps all take place one after another, but with pipelining, the next instruction is being fetched while the current one is being decoded etc.


There are two types of Pipelining
1) Instruction pipelining
	-  This consists of stages in which an instruction moves through the processor, including being fetched, buffered and executed

2)
