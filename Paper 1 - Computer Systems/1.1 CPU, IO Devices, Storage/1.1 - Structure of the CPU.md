# Internal Structure

 - There are 9 main components in the CPU, namely
	1) Program Counter
	2) Control Unity
	3) Memory Address Register
	4) Memory Location Register
	5) Arithmetic Logic Unit
	6) Accumulator
	7) Current Instruction Register
	8) Cache
	9) Buses

## Control Unit (CU)

- The broad purpose of the control unit is to co-ordinate all activities in the CPU
	- More specifically, it controls the [[1.2 - Fetch Decode Execute Cycle|Fetch Decode Execute Cycle]]

- It sends memory read/write requests to main memory on the control bus, as well as other command/control signals e.g. bus requests, bus grants, interrupt requests

## Program Counter (PC)

- This holds the address of the next instruction to be executed
	- This could include the next instruction in a big sequence of instructions
	- The address to the next instruction if the current one is a branch, this could be copied from the ***CIR***

- It works closely with the ***MAR***, at the start of the [[1.2 - Fetch Decode Execute Cycle|Fetch Decode Execute Cycle]] the address in the PC is copies to the MAR

## Memory Address Register (MAR)

- Holds the address of the memory location of either data or an instruction that is to be fetched/written to.
	- This address is sent to memory through the address bus (One way bus to memory, can only be used to write)

## Memory Data Register (MDR)

- Used to store the data that is about to be read/written
	- known as ***the gateway to the processor*** as anything that must be processed will go through the MDR first.
	- All data to and from memory must travel through the ***data bus*** (two-way bus to memory, read and write) and pass through the MDR

### Current Instruction Register (CIR)

- Used to hold the current instruction being executed (hence the name)
- The contents of the MDR are copied to the CIR if it is an instruction
	- Contains opcode (the instruction) and operand(s) (data / memory location used to execute the instruction) of the current instruction

## Arithmetic Logic Unit (ALU)

- Performs Arithmetic and logical operations on data
	- Arithmetic operations on fixed and floating point numbers
		- Add
		- Subtract
		- Multiply
		- Divide
	
	- As well as Boolean logic operations
		- Comparison
		- AND
		- OR
		- NOT
		- XOR

- Often uses General purpose registers to temporarily hold the results of calculations, such as the accumulator

## Accumulator (ACC)

- One of many general purpose registers in modern CPU's
- Data or control information is often stored in these

- A CPU may have many general purpose registers for storing temporary data while instructions or calculations are being carried out
	- Typically, the more of these general purpose registers, the faster the CPU

- Also, temporarily stores the ALU's results

# Buses

## Address Bus

- Carries memory addresses that identify where the data is being read/written to

## Data Bus

- Carries the binary 1/0s that make up the information being transmitted

## Control Bus

- Carries command and control signals to and from every other component to the CPU / computer
