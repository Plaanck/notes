- A GPU (Graphic Processing Unit) functions very similarly to a CPU, however it is designed to be mainly used in processing graphics (mainly for computer games / simulations)
	- However, in modern computers, they are used for other types of processing as well, to offload stress from the CPU

- They are very good at processing a large set of less complex instructions, whereas CPUs are better at more complex instructions in smaller sets.
	- In other words, GPU's excel in [[1.5 - CPU Architecture#Contemporary Processor Architectures||SIMD]]
