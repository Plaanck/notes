## Von Neumann Architecture

- The main things that separate the Von Neumann Architecture from others are
	- ***Shared memory for instructions and data, in the Ram***
	- Instructions and data are stored in the same format
	- A single control unit or processor follows a linear fetch, decode, execute cycle
	- One instruction at a time
	- Registers are used for fast access to instructions and data

## Harvard Architecture

- The main things that separate the Harvard Architecture from others are
	- Instructions and data stored in separate memory units
	- Each has its own bus
	- Reading and Writing can be done at the same time as Fetching
	- Used by RISC processors


## Contemporary Processor Architectures

- Modern high-performance CPU architectures incorporate aspects of both Von Neumann and Harvard.
- In one design, there is one main memory to hold both instructions and data (Von Neumann), but divide cache memory between the two, into an instruction cache and a data cache
- Some digital processors have multiple parallel data buses (2 write, 3 read) and one instruction bus.

Some types of Contemporary architectures differ from pure "older" architectures are - 

- SIMD (Single Instruction Multiple Data): Parallel processing, where a processor carries out a single instruction on multiple data items at the same time- used often in GPUs
- MIMD (Multiple Instructions Multiple Data): Another version where multiple instructions are carried on multiple data items across multiple cores
- Distributed Computing: Where multiple computers on a shared network each take part on a bigger problem - this can be done on a big scale over the internet, such as the SETI@home initiative by NASA.
