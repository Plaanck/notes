- In modern days, we often refer to the brain of the Computer as the CPU, as it processes all the data and instructions that keep a PC running
	- However, the chip we call the CPU is made of cores, which in of itself are CPU's, as they each have their own [[1.2 - Fetch Decode Execute Cycle|Fetch Decode Execute Cycle]] and registers.
	- So really, what we call the CPU is a ***Multicore processor***

## Multicore Processors

- We define a multicore processor as a single chip that contains two or more independent processing units
- These cores are integrated onto a single physical chip, known as a ***Chip Multiprocessor*** (CMP)
- CMPs with 2 cores are known as ***Dual Core Processors***, and 4 cores as ***Quad Core***, some systems can even get up to 64 cores

- The performance of a Multicore system is determined by:
	- On chip shared cache
	- Inter-core communication
- However, just increasing the core count does not necessarily double performance, as:
	- Inter-core communication gets more complex as it increases
	- Some programs cannot make use of every core
- But overall, a multicore system should always process multiple instructions faster than a single core one.

## Parallel Processing

- Parallel processing is where an instruction is split into separate tasks that each core handles independently.
- This is done by assigning each core to a different section of the [[1.2 - Fetch Decode Execute Cycle|Fetch Decode Execute Cycle]]
- The effectiveness of this is determined by:
	- The task being carried out
	- If the software is even compatible with parallel processing.
