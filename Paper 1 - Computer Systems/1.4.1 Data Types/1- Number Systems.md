# Binary

- In Computing, we use binary mostly, due to the way computers work
>	This is based on the idea that a computer only recognizes on (1) or off (0)

- It goes up in orders of 2^x every digit, in the same way that decimal goes up in 10^x

	To see how to manipulate binary for arithmetic and such see: [[2- Sign+Magnitude 2's Complement|Sign+Magnitude]], [[3- Addition and Subtraction| Simple Arithmetic]], [[4- Floating Point and Normalisation|Decimal+Standard Form]],[[5- Floating Point Arithmetic|Decimal Arithmetic]] [[6- Bitwise Manipulation|Masking]]


# Hexadecimal

- Hexadecimal, or Base 16, is also used in Computing
	- It is much easier for us to read, and much smaller, so it can be efficient for certain representation
	- It is usable in computing due to the fact that 2^4 = 16, meaning it is relatively easy to transfer back and forth from binary

- One big use for Hexadecimal is in colour, typically we represent different colours through an unique identifier, and the number would be way too long if it were presented in Binary
