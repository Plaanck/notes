# Operating Systems

- The operating system is a platform for the software of a computer to be able to communicate with the hardware.
- For example, one feature that modern operating systems have is ***Multitasking***
	- Multitasking is where you can have more that one program running at the same time. 
	- What a single core multitasking system does, is allocate a small amount of time to each process, and switch between them at a speed that we don't notice the gaps in-between.
