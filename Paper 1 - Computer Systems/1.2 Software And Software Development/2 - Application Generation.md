# Nature of Applications

- The two main parts that make up a computer system is the Hardware, and the Software
	- Hardware - The physical components used to make a Computer
	- Software - The programs / code that tells the hardware what to do

- Within this, there are generally two labels that software will normally fall under, that being - 
	- System Software - Software that keeps the computer running how it is supposed to
	- Application Software - Software that runs programs that the user wants to use, e.g. word processors, browsers etc.


# Open vs Closed Source Software

- Open source software means that the source code for the program is open to be viewed by the public, and people can modify and contribute to evolving the program. It is usually free. 
	- The OS "Linux" is open source, making it popular with programmers, as it is highly customizable, and community ran

- Closed source, or "proprietary" software is commercialised, the source code is kept from the user, and to be used, you must buy a license.
	- Microsoft's "Windows" is proprietary, and you have to buy a license to use it.


# Translators

There are a few different types of translators, but the main idea behind them is to break down code into machine code so that it can be properly processed by the computer.

## Compiler

- Compilers take the entire script, and processes it in one go, making one executable file, meaning that if there is a mistake in the code, the file will not run when opened.

## Interpreter

- Interpreters process the script, line by line, during the runtime. This means that as the code is run, it will proceed with running the script until there is an error, meaning that it can output data, and then stop running due to an error.
