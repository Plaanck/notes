# Development Methodologies

- When you develop a solution for a problem, there are many phases that the programmers need to work through
- These phases are known as the software development lifecycle (SDLC)

- 7 Phases of the SDLC are:
	- Feasibility - Is it solvable
	- Requirements - Working out what the solution needs to do
	- Analysis / Design - Working out how the solution will do it
	- Testing - Check if it actually works
	- Deployment - Installing it in the target environment
	- Evaluation - Checking in with the user, is it complete?
	- Maintenance: Ensure it continues to function, through patches and updates


- There are 5 main methodologies for software development
	- Waterfall
	- Rapid Application Development
	- Spiral
	- Agile
	- Extreme Programming

## Waterfall Lifecycle

- It derives its name from the cascading effect from one phase to another
- Each phase as a defined start and end point, with identifiable deliverables.

>There is another version of waterfall lifecycle where you are able to move back to a previous stage as well as forwards, this reflects the fact that developers often have to rework earlier stages in light of new knowledge gained as development processes


## Rapid Application Development (RAD)

- This methodology involves producing successive prototypes of the software until a final version is produced and approved
- Following initial approval of a feasible program, increasingly refined prototypes are made with reduced functionality
	- These are designed, coded, tested and evaluated with the end user

- The user may decide they are happy with the system, or that they want further improvements, which will start a new iteration.

## Spiral Model

- Spiral Model is a ***Risk Driven Development Methodology***. Any project has its own set of risks associated with it
- This model is more of a guide for development teams, allowing them to adopt elements of one or more other methodologies like waterfall or RAD

## Agile Methodology

- This refers to a group of methodologies that came about in the early 200s
- These methodologies focus on the idea that requirements will shift and change during development, which can only be dealt with by producing software in an iterative way.
- They are a more refined form of the older concepts behind RAD
