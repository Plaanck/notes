### Denial-Of-Service (DOS)

- Denial-of-service attacks when an attacker floods a server with useless traffic, causing the server to become overloaded.
- This is does by exploiting the limitations of the TCP/IP stack.
- DoS attacks often target web servers of high profile organizations, such as banks, and the government.

- A different form of DoS attack is DDoS (Distributed Denial-Of-Service) attack.
- This occurs when multiple systems orchestrate a synchronized DoS attack against a single target.
- In this example, several devices become infected, and are now acting as so-called zombies, carrying out independent Dos attacks - often without the device owner's knowledge.

### SQL Injection
