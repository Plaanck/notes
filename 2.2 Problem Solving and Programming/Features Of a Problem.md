# The basics

- Firstly, we have to think about whether a problem can be computable, given that there is an appropriate algorithm
	- A problem is considered **Computable** if an algorithm is able to solve it
- Some problems can not be solved by algorithms, 
	- This is mostly due to limitations in hardware such as not enough memory, or not a strong enough processor

- Problems also need to be **Clearly Defined**, meaning you should undertand your current position in the problem, the end goal and the potential obstacles
