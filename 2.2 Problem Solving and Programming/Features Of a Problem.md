# The basics

- Firstly, we have to think about whether a problem can be computable, given that there is an appropriate algorithm
	- A problem is considered **Computable** if an algorithm is able to solve it
- Some problems can not be solved by algorithms, 
	- This is mostly due to limitations in hardware such as not enough memory, or not a strong enough processor

- Problems also need to be **Clearly Defined**, meaning you should understand your current position in the problem, the end goal and the potential obstacles



## Problem Recognition

- Problem recognition consists of being able to fully recognize what a problem actually is, such as
	- Being able to define it
	- Being able to find the cause
	- Being able to tell if you can even feasibly solve the problem
	- What is the most efficient way to solve it?


## Decomposition

- Decomposition is the method of breaking a problem down into smaller, much more easier to manage problems.

- Structure diagrams are an approach to decomposition in a hierarchical approach
	- However not all problems are easily broke down this way, such as event-driven programs, normally based around GUI's


## Divide and Conquer

- This is a method where you normally
	1) Take a dataset
	2) Apply some rules
	3) Based on the outcome, discard unmatching data
	4) Repeat until desired result

>	This is seen well in the [[2- Binary Search|Binary Search]]


## Abstraction

- Abstraction is the process of separating ideas from reality/hiding necessary details and highlighting the ones that are useful to the user
	- One Classic example of abstraction is maps, as they hide details, e.g. it's a simplified overview of the area, rather than a satellite image, but highlight other things, e.g. icons showing points of interest, because this is useful to the user.


## Backtracking

- This is the process of incrementally building to solving an issue, and giving up on attempts that will not solve the issue, and returning to a state where it worked
	- This is not a suitable approach to all problems, but problems such as pathfinding use backtracking particularly well, especially in depth first searches
	>	See [[8- Astar Algorithm|A* Algorithm]]: Showing how backtracking can be used, as well as [[5- Binary Trees|Binary Tree]] For depth first search.

## Data Mining

- Data mining is the concept of analyzing large amounts of data from all across the internet to discover trends and more information about the topic
	- This is associated with the concept of Big Data (extremely large datasets)
