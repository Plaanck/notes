# The Nature Of Abstraction

- Abstraction is the process of separating ideas from reality – in other words, hiding unnecessary detail and showing details that are important in context.
	- Icons are a great example of abstraction – they can be used to suggest a function or process in a simple, efficient way.

>	A good example of abstraction in our day-to-day lives is maps, as we remove some details, e.g. it is not a satellite image of the land, and adds certain features such as the location of Points Of Interest
- 
	- For example, Satnav is not a hyperrealistic copy of the area you are in, it is a simplified view of the roads in the area.

- Abstraction is also used when programming, for example, 
```
x = 5
y = 6
print(x+y)
```
- The abstraction here is that x and y are variables, when programming, we are not shown all details to do with what we are making, e.g. we don't need to see what the memory location of all of our variables are, and things are highlighted according to what type of code it is e.g. function, variable etc.
